    When faced with a challenging multi-site buildout that included importing content from a very old platform, creating 3 integrated subscription forms, and launching under a tight timeline, Savas Labs was strategic, knowledgeable, and great to work with. They were the right team for our complex project!

    I have so enjoyed working with Savas Labs to redesign our online educational civil and human rights activism map. The Savas Labs staff are knowledgeable, creative problem solvers with a real commitment to Durham and to social justice. The map is now sleek and easier to use, the best since we started it in 2009.
