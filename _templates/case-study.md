Note: If this is not a premier case study, all text below the --- above should
be deleted.

## Narrative outline

Below are potential topics for discussion for the long-form narrative for
premier case studies. You will probably not want to include all of them,
perhaps the 3-4 most relevant.

### Discussion of project goals, management, and workflow

Discuss the project goals more in depth and include how the goals were formed
with the client, how the goals were to be measured from beginning to end, and
how Savas Labs worked with the client to meet those goals. Describe how the
project was run from a PM standpoint and how SL was able to guide the client
through the process with transparency and expertise. Review how SL works and
how our methodology applied to this project specifically.

### Discussion of design process and user experience consulting

Here we can highlight our design process and describe how we worked with the
client to capture their needs within the design. We can highlight modern tools
and design paradigms used in the process. We can also discuss UX design and
describe our process and its benefits.

### Discussion of audit process

If we performed an audit, we can talk about the process and the audit findings.
We can highlight how the audit provided us with information used to accurately
predict the remaining work to be done, projected hours, and timeline. This is
a good opportunity to highlight the benefits of a thorough audit.

### Discussion of technologies used

Here we can go into detail of the specific work done on the project. This
could include:

- Custom modules developed
- Custom theming
- Information architecture
- Migration
- Third party integration
- Performance improvements
- Commerce integration

### Highlighting specific features improved

If there are specific features we created or improved, we can describe the
process and results here. This is a great place to include screenshots.

### Demonstrate benefit received by the client

If we captured metrics such as performance profiling, Google analytics, etc.
we can share them here. We can also discuss less tangible results, such as
client satisfaction, improved user experience, improved design, better
adherence to modern design or accessibility standards, etc.

### Discuss positive outcomes for the company

If we have positive outcomes on our end from the project, we can highlight them
here. Some examples would be a positive experience with a new technology that we
look forward to using with other clients, working on a project that we believe
does good in the world, or successfully employing a project management workflow.
This is something often not included on other agencies' sites, but it fits
with our personable, honest brand. Note that this isn't a place to say that we
messed up and learned from it, or that we filled a gap in our knowledge. We want
this to reflect well on the company!
