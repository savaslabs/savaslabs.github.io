## The position

We are looking to hire a **mid-level to senior Drupal developer** to add to our core team. Along with extensive Drupal development experience, we greatly honor a desire for continuous growth and learning. You will have the chance to work with a stellar team that is **primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are **looking to fill the role in [Durham, NC](/durham)** but will consider the right remote candidate. At Savas, you will have a voice in the kind of work you find most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.

## Working at Savas Labs

At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work with. We **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog), [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work and we work hard. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and yet take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace inclusivity**. You'll like it here.
