### The position
We are looking to hire intermediate to senior level Drupal developers. You need to have Drupal experience, but compatibility with team culture and attitude towards learning and
improvement come paramount to incoming expert knowledge. At Savas Labs we provide peer
support and work collectively to achieve our individual and company goals. You
will work with a team primarily located in Durham, NC, though we are growing remotely. Remote and on-site positions are available. You will often interface directly with our clients. The position will require proficiency in most aspects
of Drupal development. You will also have a voice in the kind of work you find most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.

### Working at Savas Labs
At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference prezzies](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond) or [social media](https://twitter.com/Savas_Labs).
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration.
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we are upholding our commitments to one another and our clients. We
value **openness**; you are encouraged to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and fix it. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat
environment.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance**
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/mission-and-values) seriously.
We use emoji _a lot_ <img src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/thumbsup.png" alt="thumbs up emoji" class="emoji">.
You **absolutely** don't have to <img src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/relieved.png" alt="relived emoji" class="emoji">,
since **we greatly embrace diversity**!
