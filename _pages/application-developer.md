## The position

We are looking to hire a **mobile application developer** to broaden our services and lead expansion into native mobile application development. We are looking for an engineer that has experience developing and deploying native mobile applications on a team at scale. Technical acumen and ability to mentor others are equally crucial to succeed in this role. You will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are looking to fill the role in [Durham, NC](/durham) but **will consider the right remote candidate.** Your expertise in how to architect, and plan mobile applications will be relied on heavily to shape how we offer these services.

## Working at Savas Labs

At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work with. We **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. You'll like it here.
