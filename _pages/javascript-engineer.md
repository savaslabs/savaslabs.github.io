## The position

We are looking to hire a **JavaScript engineer** to develop web and native mobile applications who is experienced in the full stack though you may prefer the front or back end. You have the ability to lead and execute efficiently as an engineer, while also have a desire to support other team members in their growth. You will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. This role is for candidates who will work out of our **[Durham, NC](/durham) office only**; we are not accepting remote candidates, though we may provide relocation assistance for applicants outside of the Triangle who want to move here. You should, it's great.


## Working at Savas Labs

At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work with. We **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog), [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work and we work hard. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and yet take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace inclusivity**. You'll like it here.
