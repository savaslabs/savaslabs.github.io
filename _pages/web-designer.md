### The position
We would like to strengthen our web design offering to keep up with the

 learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference prezzies](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond) or social media.
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration.
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we are upholding our commitments to one another and our clients. We
value **openness**; you are encouraged to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and fix it. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat
environment.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance**
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun**.
We use emoji _a lot_ :+1:. You **absolutely** don't have to :relieved:,
since **we greatly embrace diversity**!
