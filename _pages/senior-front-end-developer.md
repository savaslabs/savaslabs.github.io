## The position

We seek a **senior front-end developer** to join our [core team](/company/#team) to build beautiful, thoughtful, functional and accessible web and app experiences. You will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. This role is for candidates who will work out of our **[Durham, NC](/durham) office only**; we are not accepting remote candidates, though we offer relocation assistance for applicants outside of the Triangle who want to move here. You should, it's great.

Applicants should be HTML, CSS, and web accessibility experts and be fluent in modern JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks, and front-end build tools. Candidates should have either experience or a strong interest in mentoring  other front-end team members as well as a strong desire to lead Savas in the successful application of emerging technologies for our partners. Both will be crucial to success in the role.

## Working at Savas Labs

At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work with. We **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog), [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work and we work hard. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and yet take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace inclusivity**. You'll like it here.
