### Drupal development and theming

As a pro-bono project, Savas Labs (in collaboration with a local design firm, [Cuberis](http://www.cuberis.com)) completed a full Drupal site build for Tilthy Rich. Enabling users to easily select various service options to customize their experience was a high priority, along with creating automated systems for coordinating the collection and distribution process, including a map of subscribers and periodic reminders sent to users based on options they select.

### API integration and ecommerce

Savas Labs initially integrated Paypal for processing customer subscriptions. Recently, Savas Labs developers implemented the Stripe API for a simpler customer interface and a more flexible developer experience.
