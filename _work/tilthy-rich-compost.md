### Drupal development and theming

As a pro-bono project, Savas (in collaboration with a design firm) completed a full site build for Tilthy Rich. Enabling users to easily select various service options to cusomize their experience was a high priority, along with creating automated systems for coordinating the collection and distribution process, including a map of subscibers and periodic reminders sent to users based on options they select.

### API integration and ecommerce

Savas initially integrated Paypal for processing customer subscriptions. Recently, Savas developers implemented the Stripe API for a simpler customer interface and more favorable security practices.
