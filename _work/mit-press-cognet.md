### Drupal theming

Savas developers built out a custom Drupal 7 theme based on designs provided by MIT Press for the relaunch of the site (coming later in 2015). Based on the Zurb Foundation theme, Savas harnessed the power of Sass for more efficient, less repetitive styling. Using Foundation’s grid system, Savas developers created the clean look desired by MIT Press, leading to a modern, easy to navigate site.

### Development and code cleanup

One of the biggest challenges faced by MIT Press was a legacy codebase in need of cleanup to avoid both performance and security issues. Savas diligently refactored large sections of the codebase, using Drupal’s APIs rather than fragile custom code when possible, and prioritized adherance to coding standards. The result was a far more maintainable codebase and a consistently functional site.
