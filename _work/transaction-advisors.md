### Solution

Since Transaction Advisors’ business model depends on paid subscriptions to their collection of articles and videos, it was critical that their site have a robust paywall allowing subscribers access to content, while encouraging anonymous users to register for paid accounts. Savas leveraged Drupal’s powerful core system for managing user’s roles and permissions with custom code that allows anonymous users to view an article or video description, but displays a login/register window if those users then click on the full article/video link.

Like most web-based businesses these days, Transaction Advisors knew that it wasn’t enough for their site to cater only to visitors using desktops or laptops — they found it critical to provide a great user experience on tablets and mobile devices as well. To make the best use of Transaction Advisors development budget, Savas helped Transaction Advisors select a pre-built responsive base theme and then customized it to the client’s needs. The result was a low-cost transition to a responsive, clean design that was user friendly on a variety of devices.
