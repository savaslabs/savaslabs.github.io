Compost Pedallers is a 100% bike-powered compost recycling program in Austin, TX that collects compostables from homes and businesses and pedals them directly to nearby urban farms and community gardens to grow more local food. Savas has developed numerous features for Compost Pedallers' Drupal-powered site, including ecommerce capabilities and a web service that provides an API of customer data for Compost Pedaller bikers.

### Challenges:
> - Provide a better way to manage customer subscriptions and process recurring payments.
> - Implement a more modern, responsive design that looks good on a variety of devices.

### Solution:
Savas started by cleaning up the existing codebase to ensure it was consistent with Drupal standards, laying the groundwork for sustainable development going forward.

Next, it was important to Compost Pedallers to have a lot of flexibility in their subscription plans along with automated, recurring billing. Based on Savas founder Chris Russo’s own experience running a compost service, Savas suggested that Compost Pedallers switch to Stripe as their payment processor. Stripe provides a powerful payment API allowing for complete control over the checkout experience, coupled with simple, competitive pricing and tremendous customer support. After demonstrating the benefits of Stripe to the client, Savas integrated Stripe into the existing Compost Pedallers site.

Compost Pedallers also wanted a more modern looking website that was user friendly on a variety of devices, including tablets and smart phones. To provide the most bang for the buck, Savas guided Compost Pedallers’ purchase of a responsive theme from a credible template marketplace. Savas then configured the existing site to use the new theme, providing custom code where needed to ensure the new theme worked throughout, including in the client’s online store.
