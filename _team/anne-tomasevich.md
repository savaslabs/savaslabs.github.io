Anne received a B.S. in textile engineering and worked in the clinical research industry for five years before becoming a web developer. At Savas Labs, Anne translates designs to code, builds Drupal themes, works to improve user experience, and enthusiastically [lints](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) her [SCSS](/2015/08/21/sassy-drupal-theming-part-1.html#scss). She is particularly interested in CSS preprocessors, CSS3, responsive design, styleguide-driven development, and automated testing. When her laptop is closed, Anne enjoys cooking, reading, and <a href="http://jonsebastian.bandcamp.com/">playing music</a>.
