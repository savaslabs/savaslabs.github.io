Kendall found her way into project management while working at a digital agency specializing in websites and products for the art world. From that moment on, she's worked in both in-house and agency roles leading and supporting teams to build thoughtful, impactful websites and other digital products.

Kendall is a native Floridian who came to Durham by way of NYC (otherwise known as a "half back"!) When she's not managing projects, she loves spending time with her two kitties, doing yoga, and trying to keep her daily crossword streak going.
