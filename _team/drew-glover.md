Drew has been designing professionally since 2013. He strongly believes in the commutative nature of design and utilizes his background in print and digital design towards his UI and UX work. Drew received a BA in New Media from UNC Asheville in 2012.

An Asheville native, Drew now lives in Durham, but wonâ€™t ever really be used to a flat horizon. Away from the office, Drew will be watching or attending NASCAR races, doing the NYT crossword, or talking about things he recently heard on a podcast.

Ask about his 24-pound cat, James.
