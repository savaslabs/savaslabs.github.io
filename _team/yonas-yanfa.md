Yonas Yanfa fell in love with open source software in 1997. He began working as
a computer programmer in 2002 using C/C++, PHP, FreeBSD, Slackware, and various web
technologies. In 2008, he discovered the Drupal community and has since been
[a heavy contributor](https://drupal.org/u/fizk). He is the maintainer of
[several FreeBSD ports](http://portscout.freebsd.org/yonas@fizk.net.html). He graduated
from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelors of Computer Science. In his free
time, Yonas DJs electronic music and plays blues guitar.
