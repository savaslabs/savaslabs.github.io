Jordan is a bookworm moonlighting as a marketer, and is passionate about the impact that storytelling has on a business' brand. As the Marketing Coordinator at Savas Labs, she is responsible for the curation, creation, and management of Savas' promotional content, while crafting a compelling story that ensures brand alignment. A Virginia native, Jordan moved to North Carolina to attend High Point University, and quickly fell in love with the Land of the Pines. In her spare time, you can find Jordan playing golf, trying out a new recipe, or racking up her frequent flier miles while exploring new places.
