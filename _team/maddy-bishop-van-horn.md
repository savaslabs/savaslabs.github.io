Maddy brings endless curiosity, a problem solving mindset, and a knack for clear communication to the project manager role. International program management experience spanning five continents taught Maddy adaptability and resourcefulness. She’s passionate about working closely with clients to understand goals, define solutions, tackle problems head on, and build a better web for all.

Maddy received her BS in biomedical engineering from Tulane University, with a focus on design and embedded control projects. When she isn’t helping clients bring ideas to life, you can find her volunteering with TEDxDurham and Carolina-Adopt-A-Bulls, doing yoga, and spending lots of time outdoors.
