  We migrated the Duke Cancer Institute’s site, dukecancerinstitute.org, and it’s derivative site prostateurologiccenter.dukecancerinstitute.org/ from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8, addressing accessibility and select feature enhancements along the way.
project_objective: |
  We sought to migrate dukecancerinstitute.org from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 in order to modernize the platform and improve the editorial experience, search, and accessibility. All the while, our approach sought to allow for the re-use of development efforts for the smaller spinoff site prostateurologiccenter.dukecancerinstitute.org. As always, a priority was to make this project timely and on budget resulting in a functional, smart, and easy-to-use site to support Duke Cancer Institute as an organization, their patients, students, caregivers and scientists.
project_process: |
  We began with a discovery phase, collaborating with DCI to audit the existing Drupal 7 site in order to plan the migration while identifying the critical areas to improve during the Drupal 8 upgrade. The targeted improvements focused on improving search, the editor experience, accessibility.
project_results: |
  While migrating the DCI site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 we implemented a new search feature with the ability to load more content that is specifically relevant to the user. Now, users can quickly find exactly what they’re looking for. Then, we built a more functional editor user experience providing DCI content editors more streamlined and workflow with the flexibility needed in order to maintain a cohesive content strategy.
