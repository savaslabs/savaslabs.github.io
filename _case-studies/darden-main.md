  To secure their place as one of the country’s top business schools, the Darden School of Business sought to redesign and rebuild their web properties in Drupal 8. Partnering closely with peer agency Viget on design, Savas Labs consulted throughout the design process and engineered the new Drupal 8 site.
project_objective: |
  Using design provided by Viget, we realized this was an opportunity for us to implement Drupal 8 paragraph modules that make the site more manageable for Darden’s team and content more consumable for visitors while still upholding the integrity of Darden’s vision. The new site translates the vision of UVA Darden—highlighting Darden’s mission, programs, and differentiators—in a way that effectively engages students, prospective students, faculty, thought leaders and the general public.
project_process: |
  At the onset of this project, we set out to provide Darden with a slick, efficient, and user-friendly content management interface with custom entities and a responsive user experience. Collaborating with Viget on front end code, we integrated with Drupal 8 by taking static templates and using Twig—Drupal’s templating language— to create a workflow to empower Darden’s content team to easily update the site experience.
project_results: |
  Both average site sessions and email submissions have increased since the launch of the ultra-performant, new site experience. The new Drupal 8 site allows content managers to easily author and publish content. Students, prospective students, faculty, recruiters, global leaders and alumni alike engage with a website that reflects the mission and vision of Darden:to be unparalleled in preparation for business leadership and career success.
