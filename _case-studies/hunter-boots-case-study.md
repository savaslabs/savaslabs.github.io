  After a previous agency failed to complete the complicated eCommerce site build, Savas Labs rescued the project and delivered a BlueDrop award-winning eCommerce website alongside partner Isovera. In a secondary phase, we contributed to a mobile redesign.
project_objective: |
  Rescue a build from an absentee vendor and deliver a rich and engaging shopping experience fit for the quality the Hunter brand expects in a timely fashion.

  Savas Labs built the store with Drupal Commerce which was fed by a custom content migration as well as warehouse fulfillment and reporting integrations.
