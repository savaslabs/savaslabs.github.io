project_objective: |
  Migrate the Darden School of Business’s Ideas to Action website from Wordpress to Drupal, greatly enhancing content usability and performance. We provided content editors (new to Drupal 8) with a powerful ability to create unique content by creating an intuitive CMS publishing user experience, empowering them to create dynamic, engaging content in a more efficient, streamlined manner.
project_process: |
  Training the Darden staff on Drupal 8—a flexible and powerful tool— efficiently and effectively by integrating Viget’s front end code into Drupal, which involves taking their static templates and translating them into Twig, Drupal’s templating language, enabling the templates to be dynamic with changing content. Then, configure the Drupal backend to pass us data in the proper format and output on the pages properly on the frontend.

  Savas Labs collaborated with Viget designers to use the power of Drupal 8, providing a slick content management interface, custom entities to fulfill the client’s needs, and a responsive user experience.
project_results: |
  Today, visitors to the Ideas to Action site get a glimpse of the global business thought-leader that Darden has become through the improved content structure and user experience. Both average site sessions and email submissions have increased since the launch of the ultra-performant, new site experience.
