project_description: |
  After a previous agency failed to complete the complicated eCommerce site build, Savas Labs rescued the project and delivered a BlueDrop award-winning eCommerce website alongside partner Isovera. In a secondary phase, we contributed to a mobile redesign.
project_highlights: [Responsive web design, Drupal custom module development, Drupal theming, Drupal Commerce integration]
project_objective: |
  Rescue a build from an absentee vendor and deliver a rich and engaging shopping experience fit for the quality the Hunter brand expects in a timely fashion.
project_process: |
  Savas Labs built the store with Drupal Commerce which was fed by a custom content migration as well as warehouse fulfillment and reporting integrations.
project_results: |
  The Hunter Boots website won [Acquia's BlueDrop award](http://2014.bluedropawards.org/blog-entry/2014-blue-drop-award-winners-are-announced) for best Marketplace/eCommerce site in 2014!
