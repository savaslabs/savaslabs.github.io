summary: |
  Repetitive tasks are done best by our robot friends, so we let them. Automated tests are baked into our development process so that every change we make is verified against the integrity of the entire system. Some of the technologies in our toolbox are [Behat](http://behat.org), [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org) and others, and we integrate them with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) and [Travis](http://travis-ci.org).
