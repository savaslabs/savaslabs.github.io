### Statement of Work

##### Overview

Design and implement a responsive layout for the Duke Law website and upgrade
other design elements to further modernize the look and feel of the site.

##### Details

Since the site's theme, Seven, does not include responsive functionality, we
believe moving the site to a responsive theme would be mean faster and more
predictable development than updating the current theme. Foundation and Bootstrap
are two of Drupal's most popular base themes and either would offer a highly
vetted responsive framework. Moving to a new theme offers additional advantages:

- Implementing other design element changes, such as new fonts or an updated
color scheme, would be easily done in tandem with the theme change.
- A CSS preprocessor could be set up to make future development faster.
- Using a theme that is based on responsive design means more reliable results
and less custom code.

### Tasks

##### Discovery
  - Review the current theme. Inventory template files and inspect stylesheets to
  prepare for move to a responsive Drupal theme.
  - Identify additional tasks to be completed (e.g. banner update, font and color
  changes)

##### Wireframing
  - Design layout of site on various screen sizes
  - Provide mockups to client stakeholders for review

##### Development
  - Install a responsive theme and refactor current templates and stylesheets
  - Implement responsive layout
  - Complete additional design element updates

### Deliverable

Provide updated theme implementing a modern, responsive layout on various screen
sizes while maintaining current layout and style of the desktop site.
