### Drupal theme development

Savas Labs developers built out a custom Drupal 7 theme based on design concepts provided by MIT Press for the relaunch of the CogNet site (coming in May 2015). Based on the [Zurb Foundation theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/zurb_foundation), Savas Labs harnessed the power of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for more efficient, less repetitive styling. Using Foundationâ€™s grid system, Savas Labs developers created the clean look desired by MIT Press, leading to a modern, easy to navigate site.

### Development, information architecture and code refactoring

One of the challenges in building out a new theme for the site was working with legacy custom code that mixed content with presentation, as well as an information architecture that did not fully leverage the possibilities offered by Drupal core's content type and entity system. Savas Labs diligently refactored large sections of the codebase to use Drupal's API, implemented theme hooks and templates, reformatted code for adherence to coding standards, and re-architected some of the content organization.

Savas Labs also implemented source control using Git, and established documentation and conventions for organizing a team of a dozen developers to collaborate in developing the site on GitHub. The result was a far more maintainable codebase and a consistently functional site.

### Security audit

Savas Labs performed a security audit of custom code via [automated tools](https://github.com/FloeDesignTechnologies/phpcs-security-audit) and manual code review, empowering the MIT Press team to clearly view potential issues and prioritize their resolution.

In addition to carefully removing modifications to Drupal core and contributed modules, and generating patch files, Savas Labs maintained security updates to core and contributed code for the site.
