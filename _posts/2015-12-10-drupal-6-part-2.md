## The risks of operating Drupal 6 after EOL

<img src="/assets/img/blog/risk.jpg" alt="risk">

It is helpful to think of the risks of running publicly-accessible software,
like a Drupal website, after end-of-life (EOL) from two distinct perspectives.

1. Bad things that can happen to your organization due to known security
vulnerabilities that may be exploited by the public.
 + These are the kinds of risks we typically think of when running outdated
 software. Hackers of the worst kind... the one's that are after you!
1. Good things that are less likely to happen (or even be possible) to your site
when you run old software.
 + Though easy, it's important not to underestimate this opportunity cost, as it
 is more subtle, often less pressing, harder to quantify, but ultimately often
more costly than the former.

### Bad things that can happen

<img src="/assets/img/blog/hacker2.jpg" alt="hacker">
<span class="caption">... Scary, huh? ...</span>

In the worst of scenarios, it is possible to experience

+ Complete site compromise and escalated server access due to a vulnerability
 exposed by website code.

 Yes, it is possible that with outdated and insecure code, especially when the
 exploit is publicly disseminated, your site is exposed to **complete control**
 by a nefarious (or simply bored) hacker. The best and
  decreasingly recent example in the Drupal
 world is a security vulnerability (for sites running Drupal 7.31 and earlier and Drupal
 8.0.0-beta2 and earlier) affectionately referred to as
["Drupalgeddon"](https://www.drupal.org/drupalsa05FAQ) (yes, the world is coming
to an end if your website is compromised). You can read until you're blue in
the face <img src="/assets/img/icons-and-logos/druplicon.png" alt="druplicon"> about this significant
exploit, but suffice it to summarize that a visitor without an account on your
site could completely control it with a sophisticated exploit of this vulnerability.
  Given the hacker will have access to nearly everything on the server, _he_ may
  choose his means to best exploit your site. He may

+ Add spam marketing links throughout the site.
+ Defame the site if you're a high-trafficked, reputable organization.
+ Use your server to send spam email.
+ Use any sensitive data **especially financial** he's able to access to his own
mean. [It's been done](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/).

Unfortunately, we've had a client return to us to rehab a site that has undergone
this vulnerability, suffering at least 2 of these un-pleasantries.

Having said that, given that Drupal 6 was released in
February 2008, it is less likely (though not impossible) that such a large vulnerability still exists
in the core code of the project. Higher risk vectors are contributed
modules (i.e. plugins/extensions), especially those that haven't been maintained, and certainly custom
modules, which we've seen at Savas Labs **vary widely** in adhering to best security
practices depending on the agency and/or developer who wrote it.

Therefore assessing risk factors for a Drupal 6 site as a whole is nuanced, and
requires a comprehensive site audit.

#### More subtle risks

Outdated software tends to present unpredictable obstacles based on the fact
that most of the world is no longer using the software. While your Drupal 6 site
may be fairly static from a code standpoint, the world around it continues to
adapt, update, and improve. This is the world of PHP, MySQL (the database
software used by  most Drupal sites, others are Post) and Apache (the web server used for most
Drupal sites).

Hosting providers have an interest in keeping their servers and systems up to
date for the same reasons we're discussing here: security, performance, and
functionality.

After we had finished a project with no maintenance contract with a former client
they authorized routine server maintenance, and promptly rendered their site
to the fabled [White Screen of Death](https://www.drupal.org/node/158043)
due to fatal errors caused by a PHP version update incompatibility with their
code. Though we were happy to step in during the emergency, we appreciated
how difficult it was to see coming for the client.

Much akin to the long-awaited Drupal 8 release, PHP 7 [just came out](http://php.net/archive/2015.php#id2015-12-03-1)
and boasts, like Drupal, functionality and performance improvements. According
to [a d.o post](https://www.drupal.org/node/2454439) Drupal 8 is 100% PHP 7
compatible.

Drupal 6 recommends a decidedly [small range](https://www.drupal.org/requirements) of PHP versions --  between 5.25 and 5.3.
This is potentially problematic for Drupal 6 sites since PHP 5.3 is itself
[over 6.5 years old](https://secure.php.net/releases/#5.3.0). Hosting providers
don't like that, and as time goes on there will be upward pressure on the version
 number providers are willing to support.

### Good things that can't (are unlikely to) happen?

Given exploitative risks vary by installation and implementation of your Drupal
6 site, let's look more definitively about what you won't have access to with
outdated software.

#### Your organization cannot reap the benefits of the modern web.

One example here is the concept of [responsive web design](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design).
Pulling off a responsive design for Drupal 6 is very difficult. The concept was
quite fresh when Drupal 7 was officially released (2011). Even though _most_ Drupal 7
development took place before RWD, the community was able to evolve with it and
 provide solid offerings for responsive themes and frameworks in the Drupal 7
 repository. Drupal 8 was built mobile-first and therefore is responsive out of
 the box. Another example would be the much improved, native content editing experience
 in Drupal 8. Content editing improved from Drupal 6 to 7 and made a leap from
 7 to 8 with
 [inline-editing and wysiwyg in core](https://drupalize.me/blog/201310/drupal-8-wysiwyg-and-line-editing).

#### You expose yourself to a shrinking market of developers that are able to serve you.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/small-pool.jpg" alt="small pool">

Each of the last two major releases of Drupal entail significant architectural shifts from the former.
Requisite skills in Drupal 6 for example look fairly different than those for Drupal 7.
Even greater disparities exist when comparing the object-oriented Drupal 8 to the mostly
 procedural Drupal 6.
We as developers like to build with what's
 new, and most of the market does as well, so the longer you hold out past EOL
 the smaller the pool of accessible talent
 which could also drive up the cost to contract due to scarcity. Given the limited
 pool, you may have to settle for an inexperienced developer, which can result
 in poor code quality and the associated costs that come with it. Not least of
 which is the risk of increased [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)
 that you may have to deal with down the line and [has been estimated](http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2012/02/technical-debt-how-much-is-it-really.html) to cost $3-$5 per
 line of code written.

We have a client whose undocumented and non-standard code written by several former
developers still provides the occasional production surprise and we've been
working with it for 1.5 years. This has caused our client hundreds of hours of lost
productivity spent debugging, commenting and improving legacy code rather than
 creating new functionality and features for marketing or other business needs.

#### The opportunity costs of using old software means more limited feature-set, and likely poorer performance.

A diminishing feature-set might mean you cannot easily or affordably access a
hero image homepage carousel (all the rage these days) for example. Or it might
mean you're unable to provide an editorial workflow for content publication for
different roles in your organization. Whatever the need may be, ultimately using
EOL software means you will have access to what was popular
while that software was in active development, which is likely many years prior.
Upgrading to current and actively developed software means access to the
web's current needs.

And what about site speed; how important is that? According to
[many](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html)
[different](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/)
[sources](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101-important-site-speed-2014/111924/), it's **VERY** important.

Suffice it (once again) to say that site load speed is critical and says something
about your organization's credibility. One example of an advanced web development
feature available in Drupal 8 is the impressive
[bigpipe project](https://www.drupal.org/project/big_pipe) which leverages
the power of a performance tool designed at Facebook to the betterment of the
Drupal community! It's a game-changer for caching and page responsiveness.

#### Your site looks/feels outdated.

Let's face(lift) it: We can usually tell when a website is ... _aging_. It's
somewhat unavoidable with a Drupal 6 site as it was likely designed many years
ago using practices that were the norm then. Your website is your first and most
important means to convey trust and credibility. Much of the research on users'
assessment of credibility from your website references the (ironically
poorly designed) [work of BJ Fogg of Stanford](https://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/).
Not surprisingly [web design](http://conversionxl.com/website-credibility-checklist-factors/)
tops the list as most important credibility marker, and your Drupal 6 design
and feature set is likely not going to cut it any longer.

## Part 3 and beyond

Given we have described the risk of operating a Drupal 6 site after EOL,
we'll explore your options as dictated by your tolerance for risk,
self-assessed attractiveness to exploit (are you a large retailer?),
your budget to upgrade, your time line to upgrade, and other competing business
priorities. In a follow up to that we'll discuss Drupal 7 vs. Drupal 8
decision-making (or not Drupal at all!). If we make it to part 5, we'll wrap it
up with a bang!
