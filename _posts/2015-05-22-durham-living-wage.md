Fostering a **fair** and rewarding work environment is of utmost priority for me as
an employer and providing a Living Wage is a good place to start.

We here at Savas Labs are proud members of the [Durham Living Wage Project](https://twitter.com/liveabull?lang=en).
The DLWP (I shortened it) is a new, local organization encouraging
Durhamites to take a closer look at wages, fairness, and what they suggest will
result in a better society for _all_.

> A living wage: good for business, good for workers.

## What is a Living Wage?

Simply stated by the Durham Living Wage Project:

> A living wage is the amount of income needed for an individual to meet her or his basic needs without public or private assistance.

## Why do we care?

To avoid making any sweeping political and/or philosophical generalizations in
my inaugural post, I'll reference another fellow Triangle-based author
(one blog post makes <del>you</del> me an author), [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/)'s words from a
[Ted Talk of his](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_how_equal_do_we_want_the_world_to_be_you_d_be_surprised?language=en)
I watched recently.

In his presentation, Ariely references research he's done about economic inequality:
how stratified we think it is, how we would like it to be, and how
stratified it actually is.

### How stratified do we (Americans) _think_ wealth is (in quintiles)?

| **Population** | Bottom 20% | 21-40% | 41-60% | 61-80% | Top 20% |
|:---------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| **Percentage of total wealth** | 2.9   | 6.4   | 12.0   | 20.2   | 58.5   |

Given this is what we _think_ wealth distribution looks like, the next
most intriguing and relative to Living Wage is what we _want_ wealth
distribution to be. Like any wise author should, Ariely references another,
well-known philosopher John Rawls, to introduce the concept of what we want
wealth to be by discussing Rawl's concept of
[original position](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position)
behind the [veil of ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance).
Ariely summarizes Rawl's concept:

> He said, the just society, the society that if you knew everything
about it, you would be willing to enter within a random place. And it's a
beautiful definition

Ariely illustrates this concept by surveying Americans and asking them what the
economic characteristics should be of a country they would choose to join under
the veil of ignorance. Survey participants desire the following distribution:

### How stratified do we (Americans) **_want_** wealth to be (in quintiles)?

| **Population** | Bottom 20% | 21-40% | 41-60% | 61-80% | Top 20% |
|:---------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| **Percentage of total wealth** | 10.5   | 14.1   | 21.5   | 22.0   | 31.9   |

Ariely speaks to the diversity of those surveyed about what the ideal distribution
of wealth should be:

> Liberal and conservatives, rich and poor, men and women, NPR listeners and
Forbes readers, citizens of England, Australia, and U.S., and various departments
at Harvard, they all gave us basically the same answer.

According to Ariely's research, we clearly want a more equally shared
distribution of wealth than we currently _think_ we have. So what _do_ we have?

### How stratified _is_ wealth in the U.S. (in quintiles)?

| **Population** | Bottom 20% | 21-40% | 41-60% | 61-80% | Top 20% |
|:---------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| **Percentage of total wealth** | 0.1   | 0.2   | 3.9   | 11.3   | 84.4   |

Ariely points out:

> We have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have, but
we have at least as big of a gap between what we think is right, to what we think
we have.

Therefore the gap between what
[we _actually_ have](#how-stratified-is-wealth-in-the-us-in-quintiles) and what
[we think is **just**](#how-stratified-do-we-americans-want-wealth-to-be-in-quintiles),
is astronomical. This seems to be the most objective way possible to "prove"
that wages are not as balanced as most people want them to be.

Establishing a Living Wage attempts to bring light to this reality, and speaks
to the wage floor we ought to consider when Federal minimum wage is doing an
insufficient job.

Savasians certainly support the notion that a working citizen ought to be
able to support himself or herself in the communities in which **we** live, work,
and play. Thank you [DLWP](http://www.durhamlivingwage.org)
(again, I just shortened it) for being a voice for this
issue.
