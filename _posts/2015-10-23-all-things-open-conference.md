summary: Attending and sharing experiences from the All Things Open conference.

---

Last week, I attended the
[All Things Open conference](http://allthingsopen.org/) conference. The
conference is hosted in Raleigh, so for those of us carless folks, it is a very
accessible world-class conference a mere 30-minute bus ride away. I attended
the conference last year (its 2nd year running) and enjoyed a shallow dive
into a [wide variety](http://allthingsopen.org/schedule/) of open source
technologies. Some of which was applicable to the work I was doing, and some of
which was more geared towards inspiration, new ideas, and learning about
technologies that I could utilize or at least should be aware of. This
year I attended with a similar perspective, but also with my employer (red) hat
([and shoes](https://twitter.com/Savas_Labs/status/656108971175116801)) on.

It was fun to network and discuss opportunities of diversity with organizations
like [girl develop it](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) and advocate that the
[iron yard academy](http://theironyard.com/locations/durham/)
produce a PHP / Drupal class. It was also another chance to be impressed with
conference organizer [Todd Lewis](https://twitter.com/toddlew)'s ability to say
"thank you" in nearly every sentence. Thank _you_ Todd! All-in-all-things-open
it was a productive conference for meeting people, hearing presentations, and
getting our name out there a bit more.

## Highlights

### Sessions

#### Bitcoin, the Blockchain, and Open Source
[Eric Martindale](https://twitter.com/martindale?lang=en)'s
[session on bitcoin](http://allthingsopen.org/talks/bitcoin-the-blockchain-and-open-source/)
was a very intriguing one. He described the complexity of the bitcoin system and
underlying advanced cryptographic concepts methodically, and as thoroughly
as he could in 40 minutes. Kudos. We probably won't accept payments in bitcoin
anytime too soon, but a future of a more open, and distributed financial system
seems to theoretically well-address some issues that existing concentrated
systems don't. At the very least, we have opportunities to
[bet in more open and democractic ways](http://www.augur.net/)

#### Performance Profiling Tools & Tricks
[Brad Blake](https://www.phase2technology.com/brad-blake/), self-proclaimed
[non-brony](http://whatisabrony.com/) (don't worry, I was in the dark too during
this presentation) with [Phase 2
technology](https://www.phase2technology.com/) gave an
[excellent presentation](http://allthingsopen.org/talks/performance-profiling-tools-tricks)
on performance profiling which he incidentally found out upon arrival he had 10
minutes less to give than he had prepared for. This talk was likely the most
applicable and valuable to improving our performance toolset. Perhaps the
biggest takeaway was to use
[flamegraphs](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) as [nice visualization
tools](https://github.com/msonnabaum/xhprof-flamegraphs) to assess bottlenecks
during application execution.

See [Brad's Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/Phase2Technology/performance-profiling-tools-and-tricks)
for a thorough reference.

#### Just Be Nice: Rethinking Tech Hiring

[Mark Lavin](https://twitter.com/DrOhYes) of the across-the-street
[Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/) gave [an excellent
talk](http://allthingsopen.org/talks/just-be-nice-rethinking-tech-hiring/)
about hiring in tech. This was a pervasive theme throughout the conference,
but Mark's perspective and examples were insightful and helpful, especially as
an employer.

You get the basic gist from the title, but I'll pull out a few nuggets from
[Mark's presentation](http://talks.caktusgroup.com/all-things-open/2015/hiring/#/1)

+ The following [Bertrand Russel Quote](http://talks.caktusgroup.com/all-things-open/2015/hiring/#/13)

> The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.

+ Having open code samples (e.g. a github profile) does not help candidates;
it helps employers.
  + Further to that point, Mark says

> It takes time and mentorship to contribute to open source, and not everyone
has those two things.

+ They look for people who are self-aware, know what they know, and know what
they don’t.
+ Conducting whiteboard interview exercises reinforce imposter syndrome for
folks who don’t come from CS backgrounds.
+ Rather they ask:
  + What is this person going to need to learn to be part of our team?
  + How have you functioned on teams in the past?
  + How will you function on this team?

Perhaps most salient to me was Mark's point that they are looking for someone
who is a

> cultural add, not a cultural fit.

In addition to hiring, Mark gets to work on some of the
[most important work](https://github.com/caktus/taytay) Caktus produces.

### Keynote themes
There was a _lot_ of discussion about cultivating diversity in the technology
industry. An excellent, and award-winning documentary called
[Code: Debugging the Gender Gap](http://www.codedocumentary.com/)
was screened followed by a great panel "Cultivating Diversity and Inclusion in
Projects, Communities, and Companies." I won't pretend I can capture all
of the nuances of that necessary conversation, but some highlights to me were:

+ Be mindful of the signals of culture in job descriptions - men tend to think
(most of us undeservedly so -- my assessment) that we're all rock stars,
unicorns, ninjas, gurus, or ...

```bash
[INSERT ridiculous, contemporary bro-grammer term WHERE MAX(annoying) = TRUE;]
```

+ If your company wants to hire more women, don't have your female developers
passing out t-shirts, have them interview the candidates!
+ Meritocracy can work - but hyper-confrontational meritocracy can also better
serve dominant or extroverted people.
  + To avoid this, constantly review your policies on inclusion.
+ Be visually inclusive: have pictures on your website, and booths at events
that are demographically diverse.

I look forward to Savas Labs presenting at
[#ATO2016](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATO2016?src=hash) next year.
