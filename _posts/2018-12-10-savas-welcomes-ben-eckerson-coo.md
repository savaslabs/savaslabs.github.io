For a little over a month now, [Ben Eckerson](/company/ben-eckerson) has been working hard to make an impact as Savas Labs' new and first Chief Operating Officer. Ben joins us after six years at premier digital agency [Viget]((https://www.viget.com/)), where he led business development and experimental IoT efforts for their Durham office (a couple blocks away from us in downtown Durham). Prior to Viget, Ben spent 6 years at creative New York/Durham agency [Mckinney](https://mckinney.com/).

<!-- Mention how Chris and Ben met? -->
<!-- Mention we're collaborating with Viget on Darden projects? -->

Here's Ben dressed up in his finest:

## What Ben is doing at Savas Labs

With well over a decade in leadership roles in digital agencies, Ben will help to improve our operations to enhance the value we're providing to our partners. He'll also help get the exemplary work we do here at Savas out in the world better. Known for his knack for turning creative visions into reality, Ben will be the first person a new organization has a conversation with about how we can help them achieve their hopes and dreams or the first phone chat of a [prospective job candidate](/careers). Beyond his official duties, Ben is a high-energy, team player who seeks to foster a fun and healthy culture with his new work family and we’re seeing that impact already.

## Things that have changed since Ben's start

- We've transitioned our internal team planning / scheduling efforts to use [Harvest's forecast](https://www.getharvest.com/forecast).
- We've improved our retrospective process / documentation as well as our organization of project files in our Google Drive
- We’ve had to up our Slack subscription to keep pace with Ben’s uncanny ability to find the perfect GIF (or create a new custom emoji) for any conversation.
- We've implemented a Secret Santa tradition in [the office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jCMaiTqG0).
<!-- TODO: link to Savas Claus post -->
- We’ve instituted (and started planning) semi-annual retreats to bring together the full distributed team.

## Helping to make Savas Labs more social

Ben has _gently_ recommended that we more frequently share how special what we've created at Savas Labs is -- hence my writing of this blog post ~~that he made me write~~ about him.

To his chagrin, Ben recognized most of us were not active with our personal social media accounts. For fears he was beginning to detect some [early onset grumpiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewKPi9gdT4), Ben has taken swift action to combat things before it's too late.

Welcome Ben; we're grateful to have you! :handshake:

Stay tuned :radio: for more hiring announcements coming soon.

  TODO: Verify with Anne the SCSS change is fine.
  TODO: Ask Anne to update styles so Instagram posts and LinkedIn posts are centered and padded/margined the way Twitter is

  TODO: Get Ben's thoughts about tags. My feeling is "identity" is weird and that I'd like to add/transform into "people" and/or "culture"
