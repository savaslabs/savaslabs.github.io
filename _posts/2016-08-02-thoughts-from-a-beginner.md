## The Learning Curve

Yes, the learning curve is _steep_.

I expected that when starting out (there are plenty of articles, like this [one](https://drupalize.me/blog/201607/why-learning-drupal-hard?utm_source=The+Weekly+Drop&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=The_Weekly_Drop_Issue_250_07_28_2016), that talk about why Web Development, and in particular Drupal, is hard to learn). What I didn’t expect, was how _non-linear_ the learning process is. That, and also the _sheer breadth and volume_ of material there is to learn.

Git, the command line, figuring out how to use PhpStorm (don’t even get me started on virtualization)…this will sound terribly naive, but I was shocked when I realized that Development was going to be so, so much more than reading a few good books on Drupal and CSS!

## Stop Being Afraid and Just Do

My learning style is to understand the theory first, try some example problems, then actually put things into practice. To me, this lessens the chance of screwing up (aren’t we all afraid of that?). But in an industry as explosive and changeable as Web Development is, it’s impractical to spend too much time independently “studying” rather than “doing.” As Joe Shindelar mentioned in the article linked above, there comes a point when the resources available are either too basic or too advanced to be of much help.

I’m lucky to have good mentors and encouragement from colleagues who remember what it’s like to start out. And just as importantly, I’m learning to embrace the opportunity that comes with jumping right in.

## Open Source and Community

Four months ago, I was a Mechanical Engineer working on semiconductor tool installation at Intel. At my old job, every file had a specific “classified” level and there was heavy emphasis on secrecy and IP protection. So you can imagine I found the default “open sourcesness” of the Web world a little unintuitive at first.

In the few months since I’ve made the transition, I sense that my colleagues don’t just look towards their day-to-day responsibilities at Savas, but also beyond, at what they can contribute to our community at large. This isn’t exclusive to our company either. The number of how-to articles, stack exchanges, and public repos available is inspiring.

It's clear to me that a community which values transparency and collaboration encourages the best from its members -- and can create something greater than itself. I didn't realize it then, but this is one of the best reasons for working in Web Development!
