## The options of operating Drupal 6 after EOL

Though some advisers (solicited or not) might tell you otherwise, you _always_ have options as to what to do
with your website if you're running Drupal. One of them is of course nothing, and the others require more thought.

What is the right thing to do can be a hot-button topic. Some technologists are purists,
and believe it sacrosanct to even consider running software beyond EOL. However, we appreciate
that although ideally site owners would always have been prepared and budgeted for
software upgrades, sometimes life happens, and other business priorities and budget
availability don't perfectly align with timing for a software upgrade.

One end of the spectrum is well captured by the following quotation from
the [Drupal security team](https://www.drupal.org/user/406161) that some (certainly not us
<img src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/wink.png" alt="winking emoji" class="emoji">) may consider an
alarmist reaction to one of the [most prolific Drupal security vulnerabilities to-date](https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003) colloquially referred to as "Drupalgeddon"

<br style="clear:both;">

> You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.

This is of course meant to err on the side of caution, but can
also be very anxiety provoking. Similarly, when hearing of the 3 month window for Drupal 6
support after Drupal 8.0.0 was released ["Le dendrite"](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol#comment-10556816) is not wrong to say:

> someone please settle my stomach
>
>  I was shocked to read this. it might seriously wreck me,
>  i really hope i'm misunderstanding this
>
>  will my sites just die?

That [entire thread](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol) is a
pretty good expos√© into the various perspectives and preparedness
on upgrading Drupal 6 sites. If you've got a spare half-day, give it a once-over.

On the **_other hand_**, we have had at least two clients in 2015 who continued to run
[**Drupal 5**](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-5.0) (not a typo)
websites in production successfully.

Neither end is entirely wrong, they just represent difference of opinion and available options.

## The primary options for Drupal 6 site owners are
1. Do **not** upgrade your website to a newer Drupal version
1. **Do** upgrade your website to a newer Drupal version
1. Use the time to seriously revision your website altogether

But how do you decide which option is best for you, the site owner?

That decision mostly rests on your organization's

 + risk tolerance
 + likelihood to be targeted by hackers
 + budget to improve your website

#### Considerations to _not_ upgrade

Choosing _not_ to upgrade your website is typically dictated by your organization having neither internal
technical expertise or sufficient funds to hire a partner. When this is the case, if a small budget can be
afforded, a site audit is usually the next best option to have some peace of mind that you're taking the measures you're able to
 mitigate the risk of running outdated, unsupported software. A qualified partner can perform a
thorough assessment of risk and make budget-conscious recommendations
on how to best harden the site against outside threats short of doing the more costly
full-site upgrade.

</div>
Primary attack vectors that we focus on lie in custom code, and
under-supported contributed modules since core code represents much lower risk
having been well vetted by years in the wild.
<br style="clear:both;">

One other consideration independent
of your specific website configuration is your server autonomy dictated by your hosting provider. Running old software is
usually tolerated in a shared hosting environment for only so long before upgrades
are enforced. Warning emails are often (not always) sent out in advance of server-level upgrades, however,
 it's easy to miss those emails, and it hurts to be caught by surprise that some PHP version upgrade renders
your site completely useless. Understanding the level of control you as the
site owner has over your server is crucial.

#### Considerations _to_ upgrade

Going through a typical Drupal upgrade (the update.php method) is usually the right option for you if you

 + Want to mostly preserve the site to be upgraded as-is.
 + Have a fairly straightforward site using few, and mainly popular contributed modules .
 + Decide you ought to be using supported software because you
    + have sensitive information within your site that would be disastrous if compromised.
    + have financial transactions or information housed within your site.
 + Have sufficient budget to do the work.

Upgrading a Drupal website is a **non-trivial** investment. We've definitely had conversations
 with clients to the tune of

> "oh, upgrading is not a click of a button? Phooey!"

which is very understandable. The Drupal community's stance of not retaining backwards compatibility
for the sake of keeping pace with modern web development is solid and quite defensible as well. Acquia
does a good job of addressing that in the "Support" section (unfortunately not directly linkable)
in this informative
[article about total cost of ownership](https://www.acquia.com/blog/setting-record-straight-total-cost-adobe-aem-vs-acquia)
of a Drupal site, which is in itself a topic worth a lot of consideration and analysis.

When prospective clients are committed to the time-line and investment of an upgrade,
 we always advise them to seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild/redesign as it can
 often present the path of most value. It is uncommon that a client desires to
 invest significantly to create an exact replica of the site they built 3, 4, or 5 years ago.

 In many cases, legacy content, functionality and style has outlived it's relevancy after 3 years
 and it becomes more burdensome than valuable, in the same way a poorly maintained house on a nice lot
 may be less valuable than if the lot were empty.

 Another consideration is whether or not Drupal is the right platform for your organization's needs.
 The answer to this is usually yes, especially after there is organizational
 investment and familiarity, but for less complicated sites that are open to revisioning,
 there are other options that, for example, are free to host and have no upgrade requirements
  like the [static site generator Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from which our own
   web site is built. An honest consultant will tell you when Drupal is a good fit
   and when it's not.

But alas, if you're determined to stick with Drupal
and you'd like to upgrade, the final consideration
is what platform to upgrade to, Drupal 7 or 8?

Ah-ah-ah...

that's for the next episode!

## Part 4 and beyond

Next, we'll discuss Drupal 7 vs. Drupal 8 decision-making (or not Drupal at all!).
