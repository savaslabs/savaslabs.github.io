There are [lots of free and open source software (FOSS)](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page) projects out in the world. Why do some thrive while others founder? I would argue that a strong community is needed to push FOSS projects forward. And to help that happen, organization is key.

[Drupal](https://drupal.org) is a thriving FOSS project, and one of the main organizations moving it forward is the Drupal Association. Today, Savas is proud to have become a supporting member of the [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org). In their words:

>  The Drupal Association is dedicated to helping the open-source Drupal CMS project flourish. We help the Drupal community with funding, infrastructure, education, promotion, distribution and online collaboration at Drupal.org.

By supporting the Drupal Association, we're excited to help sustain the growing network of Drupal developers around the world. But we also recognize that making a yearly payment to an organization is just the starting point.

Keep an eye on [our blog](/blog) as we've got some exciting plans to strengthen the Drupal community here in Durham, North Carolina, with trainings, community code sprints, and mentoring opportunities.
