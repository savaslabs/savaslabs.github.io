It's hard to believe it's been over a year and a half since our site's
[inaugural blog post](http://localhost:3000/2015/04/01/building-our-site.html)
(written just two months after my career change into web development!) It's been
great fun building our site and adding content thanks to the power and simplicity
of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). We recently deployed a series of changes to
optimize our CSS, JS, and images, and in doing so finally moved away from using
built-in `jekyll` commands to build the site. Instead, we're using
[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), a task runner — or, as they put so nicely on their
website, a "streaming build system". In this post I'll go over our motivations
for this change, how we integrated gulp with Jekyll, and the awesome results!

We based a lot of our gulp workflow on
[this excellent post](https://robwise.github.io/blog/jekyll-and-gulp) by Rob Wise.
Our workflow includes a few additional features like:

- Separate gulp tasks for building the site locally,
for testing purposes, and for production
- Some updated gulp plugins
- Inlining of critical CSS
- Some further improvements to responsive images

...but I'd definitely recommend his post and you'll see some of his code and
architecture throughout this article.

To see all of our current code, pop over to our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io).

## Motivation

We know how important site performance is to
[user experience](http://alistapart.com/article/improving-ux-through-front-end-performance).
We've been showing this to our clients for years, and we finally found the time
to be able to practice what we preach!

Our ultimate motivator was our not-so-great Google PageSpeed score.

![Initial Google PageSpeed Insights score for savaslabs.com. Several significant problems exist!]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/blog/pagespeed-insights-initial.jpg)
<span class="caption">Yikes!</span>

Going off of these recommendations and adding a few things of our own, we ended
up with a nice to-do list:

1. Optimize CSS:
   - [Minify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) our main
   CSS file to remove unnecessary characters and shrink the filesize.
   - Use autoprefixer to add
   [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix)
   (since this will be required for the soon-to-come Bourbon v5.0).
   - To prevent our large CSS file from delaying the initial render for the end
   user, insert CSS that's critical to above-the-fold content into the HTML
   head. By "above the fold" I mean content viewable to the user on the initial
   page load before interacting with the site.
2. Optimize JS:
   - Concatenate and [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) our JS files
   to create a single, minified file, smaller than the larger files we started with.
   - Execute our JS asynchronously, meaning it will be executed when it's ready
   while the page is loading without interfering with the render.
3. Optimize images:
   - Manually shrink our image file sizes, then set up gulp to
   [optimize](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) them even further for the
   smallest images possible.
   - Use the `<picture>` element over simple `<img>` tags. The `<picture>`
    element contains an array of different sizes of the same image and allows
    the browser to pick the smallest one that will look good on the user's
    screen size and resolution, so only the smallest possible image is loaded.

One thing reported by PageSpeed not yet on our to-do list is "leverage
browser caching" — we're not going to tackle this just yet since we're using
GitHub Pages to host our site and we don't have control over caching headers. On
a side note, if you have a solution to this problem, please leave us a comment!

From here I'll go over how we set up gulp to work with our Jekyll site, then how
we used gulp to accomplish the tasks above.

## Initial setup

### Changes to Jekyll directory structure

Our fonts, images, scripts, and SCSS files were previously stored in a directory
called `assets`. The `jekyll build` command would copy this directory into the
`_site` folder so the assets within could be included in HTML files and used to
theme the site.

```bash
~/Sites/savaslabs.com/assets $ tree -L 1
.
├── fonts
├── img
├── js
└── styles
```

Since we're going to be processing our assets with gulp instead, we moved the
`assets` directory to `_assets` to indicate that it should be ignored by Jekyll.

Our basic workflow is to use gulp to process the contents of `_assets`,
outputting them into a git-ignored directory `assets` which will be copied by
Jekyll into the generated `_site` directory. In addition, for local development
we created a `gulp serve` task using `gulp.watch()` to process assets as
they're updated and copy them directly into the `_site` directory, then push the
changes to the browser via BrowserSync.

![Diagram of our basic gulp workflow]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/blog/gulp-workflow.svg)

### Changes to Jekyll config

We also needed to make some updates to our Jekyll config:

```yaml
# Delete this since Jekyll is no longer processing sass.
sass:
  sass_dir: assets/styles

# Exclude the following from the Jekyll build process.
# Note: "vendor" is for Travis CI.
exclude: ["vendor",
          "_assets",
          "Gemfile",
          "Gemfile.lock",
          "gulpfile.js",
          "node_modules",
          "package.json"]
```

I'd also like to note that we're using a few different config files: our default
`_config.yml`, `_config.test.yml` which uses blank URL and base URL variables so
tests can be run locally, and `_config.dev.yml` which sets variables for our
local [comment server](https://github.com/savaslabs/squabble) for development
purposes. These different config files will come into play as we set up the
gulpfile.

Finally, we updated our `.gitignore` to include the following:

```text
# .gitignore
node_modules
assets
```

`node_modules` will hold all of our node.js dependencies, and `assets` is the
directory that will be generated by gulp and copied by Jekyll into the `_site`
directory. The `assets` directory (no underscore) will hold processed asset
files and we'll only be keeping the unprocessed files (the `_assets` directory)
in version control.

### Paths file

This comes straight from [Rob's post](https://robwise.github.io/blog/jekyll-and-gulp)
and is a great organization technique. In the `_assets` directory, I created a
directory called `gulp_config` to hold `paths.js`, a list of all the paths we'll
need set to javascript variables to be used in the gulpfile. We're going to be
piping a lot of files to and from gulp tasks and they'll need to land in very
specific locations so settings these variables in one place will keep us
consistent.

```js
// paths.js file

var paths = {};

// Directory locations.
paths.assetsDir       = '_assets/';      // The files Gulp will handle.
paths.jekyllDir       = '';              // The files Jekyll will handle.
paths.jekyllAssetsDir = 'assets/';       // The asset files Jekyll will handle.
paths.siteDir         = '_site/';        // The resulting static site.
paths.siteAssetsDir   = '_site/assets/'; // The resulting static site's assets.

// Folder naming conventions.
paths.postFolderName   = '_posts';
paths.draftFolderName  = '_drafts';
paths.fontFolderName   = 'fonts';
paths.imageFolderName  = 'img';
paths.scriptFolderName = 'js';
paths.stylesFolderName = 'styles';

// Asset files locations.
paths.sassFiles   = paths.assetsDir + paths.stylesFolderName;
paths.jsFiles     = paths.assetsDir + paths.scriptFolderName;
paths.imageFiles  = paths.assetsDir + paths.imageFolderName;
paths.fontFiles   = paths.assetsDir + paths.fontFolderName;

// Jekyll files locations.
paths.jekyllPostFiles  = paths.jekyllDir       + paths.postFolderName;
paths.jekyllDraftFiles = paths.jekyllDir       + paths.draftFolderName;
paths.jekyllCssFiles   = paths.jekyllAssetsDir + paths.stylesFolderName;
paths.jekyllJsFiles    = paths.jekyllAssetsDir + paths.scriptFolderName;
paths.jekyllImageFiles = paths.jekyllAssetsDir + paths.imageFolderName;
paths.jekyllFontFiles  = paths.jekyllAssetsDir + paths.fontFolderName;

// Site files locations.
paths.siteCssFiles   = paths.siteAssetsDir + paths.stylesFolderName;
paths.siteJsFiles    = paths.siteAssetsDir + paths.scriptFolderName;
paths.siteImageFiles = paths.siteAssetsDir + paths.imageFolderName;
paths.siteFontFiles  = paths.siteAssetsDir + paths.fontFolderName;

// Glob patterns by file type.
paths.sassPattern     = '/**/*.scss';
paths.jsPattern       = '/**/*.js';
paths.imagePattern    = '/**/*.+(jpg|JPG|jpeg|JPEG|png|PNG|svg|SVG|gif|GIF|webp|WEBP|tif|TIF)';
paths.markdownPattern = '/**/*.+(md|MD|markdown|MARKDOWN)';
paths.htmlPattern     = '/**/*.html';
paths.xmlPattern      = '/**/*.xml';

// Asset files globs
paths.sassFilesGlob  = paths.sassFiles  + paths.sassPattern;
paths.jsFilesGlob    = paths.jsFiles    + paths.jsPattern;
paths.imageFilesGlob = paths.imageFiles + paths.imagePattern;

// Jekyll files globs
paths.jekyllPostFilesGlob  = paths.jekyllPostFiles  + paths.markdownPattern;
paths.jekyllDraftFilesGlob = paths.jekyllDraftFiles + paths.markdownPattern;
paths.jekyllHtmlFilesGlob  = paths.jekyllDir        + paths.htmlPattern;
paths.jekyllXmlFilesGlob   = paths.jekyllDir        + paths.xmlPattern;
paths.jekyllImageFilesGlob = paths.jekyllImageFiles + paths.imagePattern;

// Site files globs
paths.siteHtmlFilesGlob = paths.siteDir + paths.htmlPattern;

module.exports = paths;
```

Later we'll include this file in our gulpfile so the variables can be accessed.

### Install dependencies

The first requirements are node.js and npm, which you can learn about installing [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Getting gulp set up is a matter of a few commands:

```bash
# Install gulp globally.
$ npm install -g gulp

# Initialize the project, following the prompts
# (most of which can be left blank and filled in later).
$ npm init

# Now that package.json has been created, start adding dependencies.
$ npm install --save-dev gulp

# Create a gulpfile in the root of the repository.
$ touch gulpfile.js
```

### Set variables and include paths

In the gulpfile, we'll start by setting up variables for the gulp plugins we'll
be using and including our paths file.

(P.S. If you're like me, you might find it easier to look at the entire gulpfile
at once - you can view ours [on GitHub](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/blob/source/gulpfile.js).)

```js
// gulpfile.js

// Define variables.
var autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer');
var browserSync  = require('browser-sync').create();
var cleancss     = require('gulp-clean-css');
var concat       = require('gulp-concat');
var del          = require('del');
var gulp         = require('gulp');
var gutil        = require('gulp-util');
var imagemin     = require('gulp-imagemin');
var notify       = require('gulp-notify');
var postcss      = require('gulp-postcss');
var rename       = require('gulp-rename');
var run          = require('gulp-run');
var runSequence  = require('run-sequence');
var sass         = require('gulp-ruby-sass');
var uglify       = require('gulp-uglify');

// Include paths file.
var paths = require('./_assets/gulp_config/paths');
```

Each plugin will need to be installed locally either by copying our
[`packages.json`](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/blob/source/package.json)
file and running `npm install`, or by running the following for each
plugin:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev [plugin-name]
```

This will install the package and add it to the `package.json` file.

## Gulp tasks

Below is an outline of the gulp tasks we'll be writing. From here, I'll go
through each individual task, then the default `gulp` and `gulp serve` commands
that tie the tasks together to build the site or serve it locally.

```js
// gulpfile.js

// Processes SCSS.
gulp.task('build:styles:main', function() {
  // Compile SCSS, run autoprefixer, and minify CSS.
});

// Creates critical CSS file.
gulp.task('build:styles:critical', function() {
  // Compile critical SCSS rules, run autoprefixer, minify CSS, and place in
  // appropriate location so it can be inlined in the HTML head.
});

// Processes JS.
gulp.task('build:scripts', function() {
  // Concatenate and uglify JS.
});

// Optimizes images.
gulp.task('build:images', function() {
  // Run imagemin.
});

// Runs jekyll build command.
gulp.task('build:jekyll', function() {
  // Run bundle exec jekyll build with appropriate config file.
});

// Builds site anew.
gulp.task('build', function() {
  // Run all build tasks.
});

// Default Task: builds site.
gulp.task('default', ['build']);

// Serves site and watches files.
gulp.task('serve', ['build'], function() {
  // Watch for changes and run appropriate build tasks when needed.
});
```

### Handle CSS

Jekyll compiles SCSS out of the box, but using gulp to process our SCSS gives us the power to do other useful things like minify our CSS, add vendor prefixes, and direct our critical CSS to the `<head>` element.

#### Process all SCSS

```js
// Uses Sass compiler to process styles, adds vendor prefixes, minifies, then
// outputs file to the appropriate location.
gulp.task('build:styles:main', function() {
    return sass(paths.sassFiles + '/main.scss', {
        style: 'compressed',
        trace: true,
        loadPath: [paths.sassFiles]
    }).pipe(postcss([ autoprefixer({ browsers: ['last 2 versions'] }) ]))
        .pipe(cleancss())
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.jekyllCssFiles))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.siteCssFiles))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream())
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});
```

This task will output `main.css` in `_site/assets/styles`.

Some notes:

- We're including all our SCSS partials in our [main.scss](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/blob/source/_assets/styles/main.scss)
file, but you could point to a directory or file glob if needed.
- We're using the [autoprefixer plugin](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for postcss. We're making heavy use of the Bourbon mixin library which currently handles some autoprefixing, but this will be dropped (hopefully soon!) in Bourbon v5.0 at which time [autoprefixer will be recommended](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

#### Critical CSS

Placing the CSS that's critical to above-the-fold content in `<style>` tags in
the HTML `<head>` to means our end user can avoid waiting on the server to load
the full CSS file on the initial page load. Identifying critical styles and
pulling them into a single file may seem daunting but there are a
[number of ways](https://css-tricks.com/authoring-critical-fold-css/#article-header-id-1)
to do this automatically. However, we found the easiest way to consolidate
critical styles for all pages on our site was to follow
[Chris Ferdinandi's method](https://gomakethings.com/inlining-critical-css-for-better-web-performance/)
and separate critical styles into their own Sass partials, then include these
partials in a `critical.scss` file. This took a
[little refactoring](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/commit/53b6d3edbace9ca7a85bd3d3d2e02e88087862b0),
but it certainly didn't hurt to make our Sass files even more modular.

After we created our `critical.scss` file, we added another gulp task to process
it:

```js
// Processes critical CSS, to be included in head.html.
gulp.task('build:styles:critical', function() {
    return sass(paths.sassFiles + '/critical.scss', {
        style: 'compressed',
        trace: true,
        loadPath: [paths.sassFiles]
    }).pipe(postcss([ autoprefixer({ browsers: ['last 2 versions'] }) ]))
        .pipe(cleancss())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('_includes'))
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});
```

This outputs a (git-ignored) `critical.css` file into our `_includes` directory.
We added the critical CSS file to our `head.html` template:

```html
{# in head.html #}
<head>
  {% raw %}
  {# Other stuff... #}

  <style>{% include critical.css %}</style>
  {% endraw %}
</head>
```

#### Load CSS asynchronously

Next, instead of loading the main CSS file all at once, we used
[Filament Group's `loadCSS` function](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS)
to load the main CSS asynchronously (plus our Google fonts):

```html
{# in head.html #}
<head>
  {% raw %}
  {# Other stuff... #}

  <script>
    !function(e){"use strict";var t=function(t,n,r){function o(e){return i.body?e():void setTimeout(function(){o(e)})}function l(){d.addEventListener&&d.removeEventListener("load",l),d.media=r||"all"}var a,i=e.document,d=i.createElement("link");if(n)a=n;else{var s=(i.body||i.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]).childNodes;a=s[s.length-1]}var u=i.styleSheets;d.rel="stylesheet",d.href=t,d.media="only x",o(function(){a.parentNode.insertBefore(d,n?a:a.nextSibling)});var f=function(e){for(var t=d.href,n=u.length;n--;)if(u[n].href===t)return e();setTimeout(function(){f(e)})};return d.addEventListener&&d.addEventListener("load",l),d.onloadcssdefined=f,f(l),d};"undefined"!=typeof exports?exports.loadCSS=t:e.loadCSS=t}("undefined"!=typeof global?global:this),function(e){if(e.loadCSS){var t=loadCSS.relpreload={};if(t.support=function(){try{return e.document.createElement("link").relList.supports("preload")}catch(t){}},t.poly=function(){for(var t=e.document.getElementsByTagName("link"),n=0;n<t.length;n++){var r=t[n];"preload"===r.rel&&"style"===r.getAttribute("as")&&(e.loadCSS(r.href,r),r.rel=null)}},!t.support()){t.poly();var n=e.setInterval(t.poly,300);e.addEventListener&&e.addEventListener("load",function(){e.clearInterval(n)})}}}(this);
    loadCSS('/assets/styles/main.css');
    loadCSS('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:400,700,400italic,700italic|PT+Serif|Source+Sans+Pro');
  </script>

  <style>{% include critical.css %}</style>
  {% endraw %}
</head>
```

As a fallback, we're loading the CSS files normally in `<noscript>` tags
in a `scripts.html` template that's included on each page after the footer.

```html
{# in scripts.html #}
<noscript>
  <link href='/assets/styles/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:400,700,400italic,700italic|PT+Serif|Source+Sans+Pro' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
</noscript>
```

#### Tasks to build all styles and delete all styles

To wrap things up, we have a task to build all styles, and a task to delete all
styles. These will come into play when we set up our main build and serve tasks.

```js
// Builds all styles.
gulp.task('build:styles', ['build:styles:main', 'build:styles:critical']);

// Deletes CSS.
gulp.task('clean:styles', function(callback) {
    del([paths.jekyllCssFiles + 'main.css',
        paths.siteCssFiles + 'main.css',
        '_includes/critical.css'
    ]);
    callback();
});
```

### Process JS and load it asynchronously

```js
// Concatenates and uglifies global JS files and outputs result to the
// appropriate location.
 gulp.task('build:scripts', function() {
     return gulp.src([
         paths.jsFiles + '/global/lib' + paths.jsPattern,
         paths.jsFiles + '/global/*.js'
     ])
         .pipe(concat('main.js'))
         .pipe(uglify())
         .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.jekyllJsFiles))
         .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.siteJsFiles))
         .on('error', gutil.log);
 });
```

This task outputs `main.js` to `_site/assets/js/main.js`. To avoid delaying the
initial render, we're loading the scripts asynchronously via the `async`
attribute in our `scripts.html` template included on each page after the footer.

```html
{# in scripts.html #}
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ '/assets/js/main.js' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" async></script>
<noscript>
  <link href='/assets/styles/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:400,700,400italic,700italic|PT+Serif|Source+Sans+Pro' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
</noscript>
```

As before, we also have a task to delete all processed scripts.

```js
// Deletes processed JS.
gulp.task('clean:scripts', function(callback) {
    del([paths.jekyllJsFiles + 'main.js', paths.siteJsFiles + 'main.js']);
    callback();
});
```

### Copy fonts

I'll quickly note that we set up a task to copy our fonts to the appropriate
directory, but we're only doing this with Font Awesome at the moment.

```js
// Copies fonts.
gulp.task('build:fonts', ['fontawesome']);

// Places Font Awesome fonts in proper location.
gulp.task('fontawesome', function() {
    return gulp.src(paths.fontFiles + '/font-awesome/**.*')
        .pipe(rename(function(path) {path.dirname = '';}))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.jekyllFontFiles))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.siteFontFiles))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream())
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});

// Deletes processed fonts.
gulp.task('clean:fonts', function(callback) {
    del([paths.jekyllFontFiles, paths.siteFontFiles]);
    callback();
});
```

### Process images

We took a few steps to optimize our site's existing images and ensure that
future images could be optimized automatically via gulp and the Jekyll build
process.

#### Manual updates to images

We knocked out some low-hanging fruit by ensuring we were using the proper image
formats and the smallest images possible. Google has a [great writeup on image
optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization)
that I'd highly recommend reading, but the gist is:

- Don't use images if you can use CSS or webfonts
- Choose the right image format:
  - If it's a vector graphic or can be converted to one, use SVG
  - If you need transparency or fine detail, use PNG
  - If you need animation, use GIF
  - Otherwise, use JPEG
- Play around with image quality to find the lowest quality that still looks great
- Your images shouldn't be any larger than the largest they'll display on your
site (keeping in mind this might be 2x for high resolution displays)

On my Mac, I used [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) to convert some of our
images from PNG to JPEG at a slightly lower quality, to save vector graphics as
SVGs when possible, and to trim images down when they were larger than they
needed to be. We also established these rules as a team for future images to be
added to our site.

#### Minify images via gulp

Next, we wrote a gulp task to run our images through the `imagemin` plugin.

```js
// Optimizes and copies image files.
gulp.task('build:images', function() {
    return gulp.src(paths.imageFilesGlob)
        .pipe(imagemin())
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.jekyllImageFiles))
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.siteImageFiles))
        .pipe(browserSync.stream());
});
```

This task outputs optimized images in `_site/assets/img`.

We also have a task to delete all processed images.

```js
// Deletes processed images.
gulp.task('clean:images', function(callback) {
    del([paths.jekyllImageFiles, paths.siteImageFiles]);
    callback();
});
```

#### Jekyll Picture Tag plugin

Between our manual updates and `imagemin`, we cut our image sizes down
drastically! Our next step was to set up the
[Jekyll Picture Tag plugin](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag).
This plugin supplies a Liquid tag to insert a `<picture>` element, which
allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image from an array of sizes.
Since our sites are viewed on so many different devices, we need to send these
devices images that make sense — loading a huge image meant for a large retina
screen on a tiny mobile phone is a waste of time and resources. The Liquid
tag provided by the plugin is much simpler than typing out all the `<picture>`
markup, and the plugin also generates the differently sized images based on some
simple config. Since the `<picture>` element has very low browser support at
this time, [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) is used as a
polyfill, meaning the resulting markup will work in all modern browsers.

But wait - how can we use a Jekyll plugin while we're hosting our site on GitHub
Pages? GitHub Pages only allows
[a few Jekyll plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) when it builds a site
for deployment, a well-known limitation. Come back soon for a post on how we're
using Travis CI to build our site for testing and deployment to GitHub Pages!

The [installation and usage](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag#installation)
documentation on Jekyll Picture Tag's GitHub repo is great, and setup is a quick
matter of installing the gem and the Picturefill script. From there, we set up
presets for repeated image styles on our site - team photos, featured
blog images, etc.

```yaml
# in config.yml
# Picture element presets
picture:
  source: "assets/img"
  output: "assets/processed-img"
  markup: "picture"
  presets:
    team_square:
      attr:
        class: "image--team-square"
        itemprop: "image"
      ppi: [1, 2]
      source_400:

```

First we set the source directory to `assets/img`, which is where images are
sent by gulp after being optimized. Resized images will be output to
`assets/processed-img`. Keep in mind that since this is being done during the
`jekyll build` process, the processed image directory will be inside the `_site`
directory.

Each preset has the following configured:

- A [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)-style
class (other attributes can be added too).
- An array of resolutions. `[1, 2]` will generate images at 1 and 2 times the
specified dimensions, and the double-sized image will be served on devices with
a resolution of at least 2 dots per pixel (better known as Retina screens).
- Source specifications. Each source contains a media query and a width to be
used at that screen size (I didn't include height so the images will be scaled
proportionally).

From here we use a simple Liquid tag to create the markup. For our
individual team member pages we insert the team member's photo with:

```html
{% raw %}
{% picture team_individual {{ page.photo }} alt="{{ page.name }}" %}
{% endraw %}
```

We're using the `team_individual` preset, so four versions of the image will be
created (two at each specified width, and two images at double those dimensions
for hi-res displays). The markup ends up like this:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="/assets/processed-img/team/anne-tomasevich-700by710-eeafb6.jpg" media="(min-width: 400px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-width: 400px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)">
  <source srcset="/assets/processed-img/team/anne-tomasevich-350by355-eeafb6.jpg" media="(min-width: 400px)">
  <source srcset="/assets/processed-img/team/anne-tomasevich-576by584-eeafb6.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-resolution: 192dpi)">
  <source srcset="/assets/processed-img/team/anne-tomasevich-288by292-eeafb6.jpg">
  <img src="/assets/processed-img/team/anne-tomasevich-288by292-eeafb6.jpg" class="image--team-individual" itemprop="image" alt="Anne Tomasevich">
</picture>
```

With some easy setup, we're cutting down drastically on the sizes of images
served at smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions!

#### Background images

One place we couldn't use this plugin is for images displayed via the CSS
`background-image` property, which we're using for some hero images. For the
large image on the home page, I manually created a variety of images (known in
the responsive image world as [art direction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/media/images#art_direction))
then used media queries to display the appropriate image as the background image.
You can check out the [SCSS on GitHub](https://github.com/savaslabs/savaslabs.github.io/blob/source/_assets/styles/scss/components/_home-cover-image.scss).
Since this is a much more time-consuming process I haven't implemented this for
all of our background images yet, but taking the time to create images that will
look exactly how we want them at all screen sizes will be well worth it!

### Build and serve tasks

To pull it all together, we have a default task to build the site (creating the
`_site` directory which holds the compiled HTML, CSS, JS, and images that comprise our site)
and a `serve` task to watch our files and rebuild the appropriate files or the
entire site when those files change.

The default task deletes the site by running the `clean` tasks then runs all the
`build` tasks, then the `jekyll build` command to build the site using our
processed assets.

A little gulp tip: tasks passed within square brackets are run concurrently (one
of the major advantages of using gulp over Grunt, which can only run one task at
a time), while items in a comma-separated list are run sequentially. We'll need
this to run the build tasks in the correct order since we need to create our
`assets` directory before running `build:jekyll`, which will copy `assets` to
`_site/assets`.

```js
// Runs jekyll build command.
gulp.task('build:jekyll', function() {
    var shellCommand = 'bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml';

    return gulp.src('')
        .pipe(run(shellCommand))
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});

// Deletes the entire _site directory.
gulp.task('clean:jekyll', function(callback) {
    del(['_site']);
    callback();
});

// Main clean task.
// Deletes _site directory and processed assets.
gulp.task('clean', ['clean:jekyll',
    'clean:fonts',
    'clean:images',
    'clean:scripts',
    'clean:styles']);

// Builds site anew.
gulp.task('build', function(callback) {
    runSequence('clean',
        ['build:scripts', 'build:images', 'build:styles', 'build:fonts'],
        'build:jekyll',
        callback);
});

// Default Task: builds site.
gulp.task('default', ['build']);
```

Now, `gulp` will run the default task `build` and will build the `_site`
directory. This is what we want in production, but let's go back to our three
separate Jekyll configuration files. We want to create gulp tasks using
`config.test.yml` for running our test script and `config.dev.yml` for local
development.

```js
// Runs jekyll build command using test config.
gulp.task('build:jekyll:test', function() {
    var shellCommand = 'bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.test.yml';

    return gulp.src('')
        .pipe(run(shellCommand))
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});

// Runs jekyll build command using local config.
gulp.task('build:jekyll:local', function() {
    var shellCommand = 'bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.test.yml,_config.dev.yml';

    return gulp.src('')
        .pipe(run(shellCommand))
        .on('error', gutil.log);
});
```

The last thing we needed is a gulp command to serve the site and watch for file
changes. To accomplish this we're using `gulp.watch()`, which tells gulp to run
a specified task if the targeted files are changed. We also created a couple of
special tasks to tell the browser to reload the served site on changes to Jekyll
files (templates, config, etc.) or Javascript files. We already included
`.pipe(browserSync.stream())` in our `build:styles:main` and `build:images` tasks, so
when these files are updated the changes will be injected into our local site
and we won't even need a refresh.

```js
// Special tasks for building and then reloading BrowserSync.
gulp.task('build:jekyll:watch', ['build:jekyll:local'], function(callback) {
    browserSync.reload();
    callback();
});

gulp.task('build:scripts:watch', ['build:scripts'], function(callback) {
    browserSync.reload();
    callback();
});

// Static Server + watching files.
// Note: passing anything besides hard-coded literal paths with globs doesn't
// seem to work with gulp.watch().
gulp.task('serve', ['build:local'], function() {

    browserSync.init({
        server: paths.siteDir,
        ghostMode: false, // Toggle to mirror clicks, reloads etc. (performance)
        logFileChanges: true,
        logLevel: 'debug',
        open: true        // Toggle to automatically open page when starting.
    });

    // Watch site settings.
    gulp.watch(['_config.yml'], ['build:jekyll:watch']);

    // Watch .scss files; changes are piped to browserSync.
    gulp.watch('_assets/styles/**/*.scss', ['build:styles']);

    // Watch .js files.
    gulp.watch('_assets/js/**/*.js', ['build:scripts:watch']);

    // Watch image files; changes are piped to browserSync.
    gulp.watch('_assets/img/**/*', ['build:images']);

    // Watch posts.
    gulp.watch('_posts/**/*.+(md|markdown|MD)', ['build:jekyll:watch']);

    // Watch drafts if --drafts flag was passed.
    if (module.exports.drafts) {
        gulp.watch('_drafts/*.+(md|markdown|MD)', ['build:jekyll:watch']);
    }

    // Watch html and markdown files.
    gulp.watch(['**/*.+(html|md|markdown|MD)', '!_site/**/*.*'], ['build:jekyll:watch']);

    // Watch RSS feed XML file.
    gulp.watch('feed.xml', ['build:jekyll:watch']);

    // Watch data files.
    gulp.watch('_data/**.*+(yml|yaml|csv|json)', ['build:jekyll:watch']);

    // Watch favicon.png.
    gulp.watch('favicon.png', ['build:jekyll:watch']);
});
```

With this, we can run `gulp serve` to fire up our site locally. The initial
build takes a bit longer than `jekyll serve` but the convenience of
automatically opening a browser window, automatic refreshing, and new CSS being
injected is fantastic!

## The Results

After implementing these changes, our mobile PageSpeed score shot up to 92/100,
with our desktop score at 95/100!

<img src="/assets/img/blog/pagespeed-insights-results.jpg" class="blog-image-xl" alt="95/100 Google PageSpeed Insights score!">

To pat ourselves on the back a little more, I should mention that we were already
doing great in the user experience department.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/pagespeed-insights-user-experience.jpg" class="blog-image-xl" alt="Passing Google PageSpeed Insights user experience items.">

That's grounds for a little celebration in my opinion!

In addition to improving performance on our existing site, we now have a
framework in place to ensure good performance in the future — using gulp to
build the site for production will automatically optimize our CSS, JS, and image
assets. Plus, our local development workflow is more streamlined both because
we took the time to think through our asset pipeline and because we can
capitalize on tools like Browsersync to enhance the development experience.

## Next Steps

There are a couple things I'd like to improve with this process:

- Once an image is optimized via imagemin it shouldn't be processed each time
`build:images` runs. By doing this, we'll save time both when building the site
for testing and deployment and for spinning up the site locally.
- Similarly, once an image is processed by Jekyll Picture Tag it doesn't need to
be re-processed on every run of `jekyll build`.
