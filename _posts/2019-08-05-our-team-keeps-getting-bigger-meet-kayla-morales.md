As you know, we‚Äôve been growing quite a bit these last few months [(still are, if you want to join us!)](/careers/). So it‚Äôs with great pleasure that we welcome our newest addition Kayla Morales to the Savas Labs team!

Kayla joins as our newest Project Manager. In between her busy days onboarding with [Maddy](/company/maddy-bishop-van-horn/), getting acclimated to the office, and taking on projects of her own, we caught up and I asked some questions for us all to get to know her a bit better. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs meet Kayla!

**Okay, Kayla, let‚Äôs just jump right in! Where did you go to college and what did you study?**

I studied History with a minor in Technical & Professional Communications at Shippensburg University.

**So, you‚Äôre a Pennsylvanian! Welcome to Durham! Tell me what you have been doing career-wise since graduation until now?**

Prior to joining the Savas Labs team, I worked as a Copywriter & Digital Marketing Specialist at a small digital marketing agency in Pennsylvania. I mainly created content/copy, managed social media platforms, and oversaw local listings for clients.

**Relocating from PA and transitioning to a more technical agency; what made you choose Savas as your next career move?**

[Savas is a growing company](/careers/), thriving at a rapid pace. I chose Savas because I wanted to be a part of an organization that is expanding, so I can grow alongside as a professional, too.

**What were/are you most excited about joining the Savas Team?**

Being a part of a [cohesive group](/company/), working alongside creative and hard-working individuals, and learning more about project management.

**Well, we are very glad you‚Äôre here! How is the Savas Team/office set-up/workflow different from what you‚Äôve experienced in the past?**

Other places that I worked at prior to joining the Savas Team were very rigid, structured, and not very collaborative. Most of the time, my thoughts and ideas surrounding certain topics or projects were never taken into account. The first day I started working at Savas, I noticed how different of a work dynamic it is compared to my prior jobs. [Savas is very much a united and communal workplace](/company/mission-and-values/), which I greatly appreciate.

I love how Savas provides a platform for others to speak and voice their thoughts about projects or other important work-related topics.

**What strengths do you bring to this team?**

Well, I believe my greatest strength is my desire to learn. Coming from a different background that didn‚Äôt center on project management, or web programming/development, it can be a challenge to get acquainted with a new industry / career field. But despite the challenges and learning curves, learning new things doesn‚Äôt intimidate me. I think the most imperative thing that any professional can do is have a zeal to learn new things, even if it may be out of their so-called ‚Äúcomfort zone.‚Äù

**That‚Äôs one (of many) reasons you make such a great addition to this team! How are you enjoying The Triangle so far? Anything unique you‚Äôve noticed?**

Raleigh and Durham are such beautiful, fun cities. I‚Äôm looking forward to visiting their many attractions and (of course) visiting as many restaurants as I can.

**Anything else that you want folks to know about you?**

I‚Äôm really boring, but here it goes! _(Author‚Äôs note: as far as we can tell, Kayla is NOT boring.)_ I‚Äôve just learned how to embroider‚ÄîI know, I‚Äôm such a grandma‚Äîwhich I now absolutely love. I didn‚Äôt think I would get involved in this kind of hobby, but now I have thanks to a wonderful friend who taught me.

I also love to read. So much so that in my junior year of college, I installed a Little Free Library in my college community for a class project. I‚Äôm super proud of it and enjoy visiting it whenever I visit Shippensburg. I‚Äôm always amazed at the amount of books that it is filled with. It definitely warms my heart to know that I‚Äôve united the community (in some little way) through literature.

So it‚Äôs no surprise that I‚Äôm a massive nerd. I love watching old classic films whenever I can!

Finally, I have a deep love for traveling. I‚Äôve visited England, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, and Mexico. Fingers crossed, I plan on exploring more wonderful countries in the near future.
