  A review of Jason Santa Maria's *On Web Typography*, and how we applied the
  lessons learned to our workflow.
---

As a developer who often interacts with and creates web designs, I'm always on the lookout for quality resources to level up my design skills, and the [Book Apart series](https://abookapart.com/) has proven to be an excellent source of knowledge presented in a relevant, concise manner. My latest read was [*On Web Typography* by Jason Santa Maria](https://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography), and I found the book to be a strong resource, especially for the non-designer. In this post, I'll review the book and detail how we at Savas Labs implemented the lessons we learned.

## Thinking about reading

Have you ever stopped to think about the actual process of reading? I think
Santa Maria puts it best:

> Reading is something we do every day, but we can easily take it for granted. Slapping words on a page won’t ensure good communication, just as mashing your hands across a piano won’t make for a pleasant composition. The experience of reading and the effectiveness of our message are determined by both what we say and how we say it.

Rather than jumping into choosing and pairing typefaces, or even evaluating
their characteristics, Santa Maria suggests we approach typography much further
back and take the time to consider what users are actually doing when they read
text on our sites. This is something I hadn't considered before and brings a
depth to the process that is so much more than picking and applying fonts. In
addition to aesthetics, type design can have a significant effect on user
experience and, therefore, is doubly important to consider during the design
process.

## Base knowledge

Most of us can tell a serif from a sans serif, but I found the base of knowledge
Santa Maria provides in the book to be an incredibly useful foundation. Knowing
some critical terminology and history has already improved my ability to design
type, and this section is compact enough to be a quick overview with serious
payoff.

In the book, Santa Maria covers:

- An extremely brief yet useful history of type, focused on how typefaces were
created through most of history before the web and how things changed as
communication became increasingly digital
- Terminology used to describe typefaces and their elements
- Methods for classifying typefaces that are descriptive and useful when
evaluating and choosing typefaces
- An overview of the characters and styles that a well-developed typeface will
offer (true bolds and italics, language sets and punctuation among others)

## Evaluating typefaces

After reviewing the building blocks that make up a typeface, Santa Maria applies
this knowledge by walking the reader through the process of evaluating two
classic typefaces. This section is a clear presentation of how to dissect a
typeface and understand its geometric structure, tone, history, and classification.
Santa Maria also demonstrates how one can capitalize on the tried-and-tested
nature of classic typefaces by looking to revivals and alternatives inspired by
those classics. These exercises will help you understand typefaces on a deeper
level and prepare you for the next part: actually selecting and applying them.

## Choosing and pairing typefaces

All the previous sections culminate in the ultimate goal: how to design type for
your site. Santa Maria introduces two separate contexts to consider: type for a
moment (a menu link, a heading, etc.) and type to live with (long text).

<span class="caption">Some examples of the two contexts</span>

These contexts demand different typeface choices based on what's important
to the reader — quickly understanding a snippet of text, or reading
paragraphs of text without becoming fatigued or distracted.

Santa Maria provides some helpful step-by-step methods for choosing typefaces.
My favorite was word association, something we may all be familiar with, but he
builds this process out in a way that seems easy and effective.

Another important skill covered is pairing typefaces, something that poses a
challenge to many of us. Santa Maria suggests a balance between two typefaces'
distinction from each other and cohesion with each other, demonstrated with
numerous examples, and explained with reference to the type terminology and
classification methods reviewed in previous chapters.

## What's next?

After finishing the book, I had a couple of questions:

### How can I actively improve my type design skills?

After reading design resources, I usually feel armed with new information but
unsure of how to actually apply it. I've found that improving design skills
isn't something that happens instantly after you've learned something new
— it takes practice!

One of the methods I've found most helpful is to keep an eye out for
design elements I like, and when I see them, break them down and figure out
why they work. For typography, this would mean identifying the context,
classifying the typeface, evaluating the letterforms to identify their physical
characteristics and the feelings they invoke, and (this is key)
bookmarking the source in an "Inspiration" folder. [Entire books have been
written about this process](http://austinkleon.com/steal/), so don't be afraid
to be inspired by others' work!

<span class="caption">Some samples from my Inspiration folder</span>

After perusing my Inspiration folder, I follow these guidelines when designing
type:

- Keep it simple. It's conventional to use a maximum of two typefaces, and often
using typefaces within the same family or a single typeface in multiple styles
gives you all the variety you need.
- Try things out in context. This is recommended by Santa Maria in the book, and
giving typefaces and pairings a shot on your actual site (or a local version) is
crucial. Most paid fonts are available via free trials, so no excuses!

### How can our team apply this knowledge?

Much of the team at Savas Labs focuses on back-end development, but we all have
a desire to be holistic teammates with some proficiency at every stage of the
process. We don't all have the time to invest in becoming typography experts
— one can spend an entire career doing so — so we wanted to find ways to
enable our team to be able to consult on typography and make informed decisions
on type design when needed.

To this end, we created a repository where we can continue to house a list of
go-to typefaces, tried-and-tested pairings, favorite foundries, and excellent
type resources. Curating this list and adding to it whenever we find something
we like will provides with an easy reference so we're not starting from scratch
every time, and is a nice way to practice the skills suggested above.

## Closing thoughts

I would highly recommend checking out [*On Web Typography*](https://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography),
especially if you're a typography novice looking to step up your game. In
closing, I'll leave you with Santa Maria's thoughts on another benefit of
developing type design skills: a greater sense of [empathy](/mission-and-values/#empathize) for your website's
users.

> Being good at typography makes you a more adept thinker, communicator, and
designer. When you immerse yourself in the fine details of text, you not
only make yourself aware of those details and how they affect communication,
but you also put yourself in your readers’ shoes.
